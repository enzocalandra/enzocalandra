- 👋 Hello there, everyone! I’m @enzocalandra
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, databases, cybersecurity and cloud computing.
- 🌱 I’m a beginner in this world and I'm currently learning (or trying to) C#/.NET, Python, Java, and the basic front-end development tools (HTML/CSS/Javascript).
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn and collaborate with the community as soon as I get my skills improved. I also expect to become a software developer in the near future.
- 📫 The easiest ways to reach me is through my e-mail (enzocalandra.tech@gmail.com) and LinkedIn profile (https://www.linkedin.com/in/enzocalandra).
- I hope I can achieve a lot with you all in here!
