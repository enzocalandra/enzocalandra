- 👀 I’m interested in software development, databases, systems management and everything related to technology and automatization.
- 🌱 Currently studying Systems Analyses and Development, back-end structures, some things about front-end too, using modern tools such as Java, Python, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Google Cloud, JS, among others.
- 💞️ I’m excited to learn each day and eager to collaborate with the community as much as I can.
- 📫 The easiest ways to reach me is through my e-mail (enzocalandra.tech@gmail.com) and LinkedIn profile (https://www.linkedin.com/in/enzocalandra).
